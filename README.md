# city-level-employment

## Name: City-Level Employment Statistics: Interactive Visualizations of Employment Statistics for Top US Cities ## Goal/Plan/Proposal: The aim of my project is to clearly represent recent employment statistics for individual large US cities. I plan to provide a dashboard/page through which users can visualize city-level data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) around key employment/unemployment metrics. I will display city-specific data on an interactive map of the US and provide options for users to select specific metrics to visualize. I also plan to provide options for users to select specific cities in order to view charts showing city-specific details, including the paths/trends of key metrics over recent history.
